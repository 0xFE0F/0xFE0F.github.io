hai, i'm charlie!

i enjoy unicode stuff since fonts are funny
that and a lot of games with support for them have some funny interpretations of certain ones

i also really like games that let me script in my own stuff
games that i play not because i can script in them but because they're just fun are tf2 and minecraft</pre>

i dont go to gay pride parades, but i dont literally murder gay people, i dont care what other people do, do what you want
i make edgy jokes sometimes, either deal with it, or dont talk to me</pre>

some random info you probably dont care about:

birthday: march 12 (mark your calendar and say happy birthday pl0x)
banner color: #232429 (funny discord banner color that looks like no banner color if you are using dark mode, this is mostly here for myself)</pre>
