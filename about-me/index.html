here are some things to know:

im asexual !!! (if you wanna sign up to invade denmark please refer to my <a href="https://forms.gle/t52GHhHtnC7BcTQLA">google form</a>)

i dont go to lgbt parades, but i dont have a problem with lgbt, i dont mind what other people do (unless it harms me or others), do what you want it's not my business
i make dark/edgy jokes sometimes, if they make you uncomfortable please tell me and i wont make them around you!
    
if i get your pronouns wrong please correct me as soon as possible or else i may form a habit of calling you the incorrect pronouns!</pre>
