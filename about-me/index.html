ahoy!
i'm charlie!

(totally fun and not depressing) fact: if i'm not constantly reminded that i'm loved i will cry myself to sleep, do you want to be the reason why?

i enjoy unicode stuff since fonts are funny
that and a lot of games with support for them have some funny interpretations of certain ones

i also really like games that let me script in my own stuff
games that i play not because i can script in them but because they're just fun are tf2 and minecraft
