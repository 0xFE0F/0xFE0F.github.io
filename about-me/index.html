ahoy!
i'm charlie!

(totally fun and not depressing) fact: if i'm not constantly reminded that i'm loved i will cry myself to sleep, do you want to be the reason why?

i enjoy unicode stuff since fonts are funny
that and a lot of games with support for them have some funny interpretations of certain ones

i also really like games that let me script in my own stuff
games that i play not because i can script in them but because they're just fun are tf2 and minecraft</pre>

here are some things to know:

about trans people, no i dont have a problem with them BUT i dont think children should be allowed to do surgery and stuff
they're not old enough to make that big of a choice yet, and they might even regret it in the future, when they're an adult though
i do not give a crap after that point

about pronouns, if i get yours wrong, feel free to correct me and i'll use the correct ones (unless you tell me anything besides she, her, he, and him) also no, "they" and "them"
are just words to refer to a person without mentioning a gender, usually used if you dont know their gender THEY ARE NOT PRONOUNS, STOP SAYING "ERM THEY/THEM ISNT MY PRONOUNS"
sorry, but i refuse to call anyone "xe" or "xem", it just sounds so stupid, and will instead just call you they and them (yet again, general terms, not pronouns)

i dont go to gay pride parades, but i dont literally murder gay people, i dont care what other people do, do what you want
i make edgy jokes, deal with it, if you cant, dont talk to me <33

i'm not homosexual, a lot of people think i am for some reason?
also NO i'm not a femboy so stop calling me one</pre>

some random info you probably dont care about:

birthday: march 12 (mark your calendar and say happy birthday pl0x)
banner color: #232429 (funny discord banner color that looks like no banner color if you are using dark mode, this is mostly here for myself)</pre>
