i like emoji/unicode-related things, i also like pretty much any
game with scripting support

some games i play because i find them enjoyable outside of scripting are:
Team Fortress 2 & Minecraft

some info related to TF2:

to the people who are either new to english, or just dumb, here is the oxford definition of "Taunt": taunt somebody to try to make somebody angry or upset by saying unkind things about them, laughing at their failures, etc.

or in other words
TAUNT: TAUNT SOMEONE TO PISS THEM OFF

(you can imagine the intent the tf2 devs had behind taunts, of course eventually they just became dances/emotes, but still keep this in mind if you dont wanna seem like a toxic piece of garbage)

if i taunt and i kill-bind right after: i think something was funny, but i don't have a problem with you
if i taunt and don't kill-bind: i probably think you deserved to be laughed at

reasons i think you deserve to be laughed at:
1. you're toxic (yes, taunting after killing someone is toxic, it's called a "TAUNT" for a reason)
2. you're like, actually dumb (no, random crits aren't a "fun" game mechanic, and no, The Original isn't a crutch IT CHANGES JACK)
3. you get way too pissy over one chat message i made (i literally just said spy is annoying and someone started crying in chat)

yes, I do "complain" a lot in chat, but that's just because I love TF2 and just wish the balancing was better
here are some changes you'll probably hear me "whine" about a lot:

☄️ buff the ambassador, give it a shorter headshot cooldown (seriously, it's just a worse sniper rifle)
☄️ nerf engineer's ability to fix buildings (play 2Fort to understand why this is a serious complaint)
☄️ remove random crits
☄️ make every melee weapon crit every three attacks
☄️ make Scout's melee do SLIGHTLY more damage (he's seriously way too weak for his own good)

these last ones are jokes, but they stem from real (and mostly valid) complaints:

☄️ remove all non-bow sniper weapons
☄️ remove engineer
☄️ remove pyro
